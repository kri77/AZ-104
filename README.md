# AZ-104 Complete Lab Collection – Hands-On Administrator Training

This repository contains a full set of 12 practical Azure labs designed to help you build the skills required for the AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator certification.
The labs follow a realistic, scenario-based approach and focus on how Azure works in practice.

You’ll work directly in the Azure portal, and in many labs also with Azure CLI, identities, scaling, networking, monitoring, containers, automation, and security.
The goal is simple: make you confident, fast, and technically solid in core Azure administration tasks.

## What This Lab Pack Aims to Achieve

By completing these labs, you will:

- Build a deep, practical understanding of the core services covered in AZ-104  
- Learn how to design, deploy, secure, and operate Azure workloads  
- Work with real-world scenarios you actually meet as an Azure admin  
- Strengthen your ability to troubleshoot and validate deployments  
- Develop repeatable patterns you can use in your own environment  
- Prepare for both the exam and real-life Azure operations  

Each lab gives you a clear scenario, step-by-step tasks, and validation steps so you always know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.
